# **SEARCH ENGINE PROJECT** Inverted Index :mag:

In this repository, you can find a source code for building up an inverted index for several plain text files (.txt), located in Datalake/books, and directly obtained from Project Gutenberg. We also implemented both relational and non-relational datamarts in order to be able to make queries to the index, which will be useful in the next phase of this Search Engine Project, and will give real functionality to the project.

To check the obtained results, you can read the article [Inverted Index](/Inverted_Index_Task_Description_and_Results.pdf).
