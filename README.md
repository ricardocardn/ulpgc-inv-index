# **SEARCH ENGINE PROJECT** Inverted Index :mag:

In this repository, you can find a source code for building up an inverted index for several plain text files (.txt), all of them obtained from Project Gutenberg. To do so, we implemented both relational and non-relational datamarts in order to be able to make queries to the index, which will be useful in the next phase of this Search Engine Project, and will give real functionality. 

To check the obtained results, you can read the article [Inverted Index](/blob/main/Inverted_Index_Task_Description_and_Results.pdf).
